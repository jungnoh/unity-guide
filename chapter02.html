            <h2>2.1 Unity Editor Deep Dive</h2>
            
            <p>As a DevOps engineer, you're accustomed to powerful development environments that streamline your workflow and provide comprehensive tooling. Unity's Editor represents a paradigm shift from traditional IDEs—it's not just a code editor, but a complete game development workbench that combines visual scene editing, code development, asset management, debugging, and deployment capabilities into a single, integrated environment.</p>

            <p>The fundamental difference lies in Unity's hybrid approach to development. While traditional IDEs like Visual Studio or VS Code focus primarily on code editing with some visual debugging capabilities, Unity Editor treats your game world as a living, interactive environment that you can modify in real-time. This means you can place objects in your game world, configure their properties visually, test interactions immediately, and see changes reflected instantly—all while your game is running.</p>

            <p>This approach might feel foreign at first, especially coming from server-side development where everything is code-driven and configuration-based. However, once you understand the power of this visual-first approach, you'll appreciate how it accelerates game development by making complex 3D relationships and interactions immediately tangible.</p>

            <div class="interactive-demo">
                <h3>Understanding the Paradigm Shift</h3>
                <p>Let's examine how Unity's approach differs from traditional development environments you're familiar with:</p>
                
                <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 2rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
                    <div>
                        <h4 style="color: var(--primary-color);">Traditional Development (VS Code/Visual Studio)</h4>
                        <p>In traditional development, you work primarily with text files and configurations. Your application's structure is defined through code, and you visualize the results by running the application. Changes require stopping, recompiling, and restarting the application to see results.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4 style="color: var(--accent-color);">Unity Development</h4>
                        <p>Unity blends visual editing with code development. You can see your game world in real-time, manipulate objects visually, and test changes immediately without stopping the game. Code integrates seamlessly with visual elements through a component-based architecture.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Navigating the Unity Editor Interface</h3>

            <p>When you first open Unity, the interface can seem overwhelming—there are multiple windows, panels, and tools scattered across the screen. However, there's a logical organization to this apparent chaos. Each window serves a specific purpose in the game development workflow, and understanding how they interconnect is crucial for efficient development.</p>

            <p>Think of Unity's interface like a mission control center where each panel provides different types of information about your game. Just as you might have multiple monitors in a DevOps setup—one showing system metrics, another displaying logs, and a third with your IDE—Unity arranges different aspects of your game development into specialized windows.</p>

            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <h4>Unity Editor Layout Overview</h4>
                <p>The default Unity layout follows a logical structure that mirrors many professional development tools. Here's how the interface is organized:</p>

            <h3>Understanding Unity's Core Windows</h3>

            <p>Each window in Unity serves a distinct purpose in your development workflow. Let's explore the four primary windows you'll work with daily, drawing parallels to tools and concepts you already know from DevOps and web development.</p>

            <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr)); gap: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <div class="alert alert-info">
                    <h4>🗂️ Hierarchy Window</h4>
                    <p>The Hierarchy window functions like a Docker Compose service list or a file tree in your IDE. It displays all GameObjects (the fundamental entities in your game) within the current scene, organized in a tree structure that shows parent-child relationships.</p>
                    
                    <p>Just as you might have a web service that contains multiple microservices, Unity GameObjects can contain child objects. For example, a Player GameObject might contain child objects for the player's weapon, health bar, and collision detection areas. You can enable or disable entire object hierarchies, reorganize them through drag-and-drop, and quickly navigate to any object in your scene.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    <h4>🎬 Scene Window</h4>
                    <p>The Scene window is your primary visual editor—think of it as a 3D version of a web browser's developer tools, but for manipulating your game world in real-time. This is where you visually construct your game scenes, position objects, and see exactly how they'll appear to players.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unlike traditional development where you visualize results by running your application, Unity's Scene window provides immediate visual feedback. You can move objects with intuitive gizmos (visual manipulation tools), preview how your game will look from different camera angles, and see changes instantly without stopping or restarting your game.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="alert alert-warning">
                    <h4>🔍 Inspector Window</h4>
                    <p>The Inspector is Unity's equivalent to Docker container details or Kubernetes resource specifications—it shows you all the properties and configurations of whatever you've selected. When you select a GameObject, the Inspector reveals all its components and allows you to modify their properties in real-time.</p>
                    
                    <p>This is where Unity's component-based architecture shines. Just as you might configure a Docker container with environment variables, volumes, and network settings, Unity GameObjects are configured through components that handle rendering, physics, audio, custom scripts, and more. The Inspector makes these configurations visual and immediately accessible.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="alert alert-danger">
                    <h4>📁 Project Window</h4>
                    <p>The Project window serves as Unity's file explorer, similar to VS Code's file tree or a repository browser. It shows all assets in your project—scripts, images, audio files, 3D models, and more. However, unlike a simple file browser, Unity's Project window understands relationships between assets and provides powerful search and filtering capabilities.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unity automatically tracks dependencies between assets, much like how package managers track dependencies between libraries. When you import an image, Unity automatically generates metadata and optimized versions for different platforms. The Project window gives you control over these assets and their import settings.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>2.2 Professional Project Structure</h2>

            <p>Coming from a DevOps background, you already understand how critical proper project organization is for maintainability, team collaboration, and scalability. A poorly organized codebase becomes a nightmare to debug, deploy, and extend—the same principles apply to Unity projects, but with additional considerations for game-specific assets like 3D models, textures, audio files, and scene data.</p>

            <p>Unity projects have a unique structure that differs significantly from traditional software projects. While a typical web application might organize files primarily by functionality (controllers, models, views), Unity projects must balance functional organization with asset types and performance considerations. The way you structure your Unity project can dramatically impact build times, asset loading performance, and team productivity.</p>

            <p>Moreover, Unity's asset pipeline introduces dependencies that don't exist in traditional software development. A single 3D model might depend on materials, which depend on textures, which might be referenced by multiple scenes. Understanding these relationships and organizing your project to minimize complexity is essential for professional game development.</p>

            <h3>Understanding Unity's Project Anatomy</h3>

            <p>Before diving into recommended folder structures, it's important to understand how Unity organizes projects at the file system level. Unlike web applications where you have complete control over your project structure, Unity imposes certain conventions and generates specific folders that serve critical functions in the build and development process.</p>

            <p>When you create a new Unity project, several folders are automatically generated. Some of these should be committed to version control, others should be ignored, and some serve as caches that Unity manages automatically. Understanding the purpose of each folder will help you make informed decisions about project organization and version control configuration.</p>

# Common Unity merge conflicts:

1. Scene files (.unity):
   - Use Unity's Smart Merge tool
   - Or recreate conflicted objects manually

2. Prefab files (.prefab):
   - Similar to scenes, use Smart Merge
   - Test prefab functionality after merge

3. Project settings:
   - Usually safe to take "theirs" version
   - Review settings after merge

# Setup Unity Smart Merge:
# 1. Install UnityYAMLMerge tool
# 2. Configure in .gitconfig:

git config merge.unityyamlmerge.name "Unity YAML Merge"
git config merge.unityyamlmerge.driver "'/path/to/UnityYAMLMerge' merge -p %O %B %A %A"
git config merge.unityyamlmerge.recursive binary
